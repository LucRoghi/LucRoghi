### About me
Hi, Iâ€™m @LucRoghi. I am a graduate of the Bachelor of ICT, Software Engineering Pathway at Ara Institute of Canterbury.

I have been learning programming since I was 16 years old. I attempted to get a Computer Engineering Degree at the University of Canterbury but realized that the approach to learning did not suit me. I switched over to a Polytech due to the assignments not only involving learning but also doing. 

#### What do I specialize in

- .NET / ASP.Net
- Python
- MySQL
- C# within the Unity Game Engine
- Typescript
